# Open Export Folder

This plugin opens the export folder in Finder after an export operation. It has no menu items, since the only thing it does is automatically open the Finder when the export operation has completed.

## Installation

[Download the plugin](https://github.com/bomberstudios/open-export-folder/releases/latest/download/open-export-folder.sketchplugin.zip), unzip it and double click on the .sketchplugin file.
